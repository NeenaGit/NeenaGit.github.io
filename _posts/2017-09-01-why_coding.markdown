My professional background has been in design. For the past 16 years, I have been working as a freelance web/app designer in New York. Through my design background, I’ve gotten to know how to design with development in mind, and it has also helped me to understand how code works, and how problem solving is a big part of it.

At the moment, I’m at a point in my life, where I’m no longer challenged as a designer, and is looking for something that could take me out of my comfort zone. So, pursuing a career as a software developer was a natural choice for me, since design and code went hand in hand, and it has always interested me to find out what was happening behind the scenes. I believe this is a field that will challenge me intellectually, and constantly propel me to learn more, and expand my learning capabilities. I truly enjoy the challenge of it, working through the big learning curve, and truly excited about the possibilites, it will bring me.
