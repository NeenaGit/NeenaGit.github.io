Been attending as many study sessions I could possibly attend these days. It’s helped me tremendously in getting used to coding. Watching other people code, and seeing how others find solutions has helped greatly in how I find the solutions. Also, attending study sessions that are much farther down in the curriculum than my own, has helped to get my feet wet on the languages I’ll be taking on later on. I do feel bad that I’m being a silent observer in most of these labs than an active participant, but I feel that it’s a necessary part of the process. Maybe one day I’ll be brave enough to share my own screens with others.
