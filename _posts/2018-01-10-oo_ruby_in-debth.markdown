Currently, deep diving more into inner workings of OO Ruby, which I find to be very exciting and eye opening. Finally, relieved to see that there are dedicated lessons to “self” and class/instance methods and variables. Even though it was good to vaguely get my feet in earlier lessons about self, and other aspects of Ruby, it was very daunting to see that these lessons and supplementary videos were talking about concepts which were not taught to me beforehand, and it was almost as if I had to learn them on my own. Which I did do. I read about it, and watched a ton of YouTube videos on it. Maybe these exercises prepared me for the actual lessons to come. One thing I am glad about is once I did start learning about these concepts in depth, I did find the Learn lessons to be much easier to comprehend, which was a big relief. 

These days I’m feeling more and more at ease with Ruby. About how the methods work, and how each aspects of a class talk to each other. Even getting more comfortable figuring out methods on my own. Now I look forward to each lab and not dread them because I know somehow, I can solve them and not have to resort to asking for help.
