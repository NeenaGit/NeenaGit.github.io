Compared to Ruby, CSS and HTML seems like a walk in the park. Couldn’t believe how fast I breezed though the lessons. I’m pretty sure I can make a website on my own based on what I’ve learned so far. When I used to work as a designer, even though I knew enough CSS and HTML to get by, it still felt like a foreign language. But it was me being ignorant of the unknown, when it actuality, these languages are pretty sensible and easily learned. Learning CSS and HTML also dispelled allot of assumptions I had about front end development. If I’d known then what I know now of these languages, I could’ve been a more effective designer and have the courage to push the limits of my designs. I guess in this example, what I didn’t know, did hurt me.
