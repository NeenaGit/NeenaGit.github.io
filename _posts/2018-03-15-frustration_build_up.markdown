I sort of forgot to up date my blog post for the past 3 months. How the time flies. Had to take some time off to work to make some money, so my progress has been very slow. But I did manage to review all the past lessons which was great. Now back to learning fulltime, and dealing with frustration full time. But I have hope. Slowely I'm understanding more and chipping away at it. Just learning to play a piano. I remember once someone saying, when you feel frustrated while studying, it's your brain learning!
