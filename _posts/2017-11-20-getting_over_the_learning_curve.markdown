Starting to learn about hashes and symbol. I am actually starting to get excited to about doing labs. No longer do I look at it as drudgery, or as something that slows me down. I now look at it as a challenge, like a game to which I know, somehow, I can figure out the solution, and also the fact that I can actually solve the labs on my own, which I consider a miracle, since even a month ago, this coding business seemed like a parallel universe to which I was dropped into. Even though I’m using online resources to find the solutions to solve the labs, I’m learning a whole lot. Love that I can find solutions directly without having to ask for help, or trying to figure out methods that I didn’t even know existed. The only gripe I have about the lessons are that some lessons could be placed before certain labs. Some of the solutions that were needed for certain labs were taught in the lesson that followed that lab, or maybe the tech-help suggested that I use those syntax before it was meant to be introduced. 

I’m a little bit proud to say that I’m starting to thing like a coder. A person who thinks more logically and precisely. Even getting better at playing board games. Starting to beat my friends all the time now at playing Rummikub. I feel kinda bad about it, but I do like winning.

As a person who believes that hard work pays off, I know the time and effort that I put into becoming a full-stack developer will pay off. I must continue to believe that persistence will help me to get to where I want to get into, and everything will workout for my benefit.The content of your blog post goes here.
