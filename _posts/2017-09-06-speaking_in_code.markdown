Why is it so difficult for me to get my head around what's being taught. It's truly amazing, how big my learning curve is. I understand the concepts, but I'm having a hard time putting different methods together. Sometimes the lessons are so overwhelming. I wish some lessons were introduced in smaller chunks, and there's more helper videos that shows more examples. That way I'm able to understand and be more confident in writing the methods or blocks. I wish I was able to connect the dots faster. But I guess this is the frustration everyone goes through in the beginning. I do feel good that I'm able to understand the code itself, but I guess I need to dig a little deeper and practice allot more, in order to complete the lessons. My brain is on fire!
